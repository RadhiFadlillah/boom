# Boom

Boom is a simple static site generator for creating a simple site. "Boom" apparently means "tree" in Dutch language, so I thought it's a good name because :

- It's easy to say;
- It's suitable for the app purpose since the content of site will be structured like a tree inside directories.

## Features

- Easy to install and use;
- Doesn't require any external dependency;
- Easy and flexible to theme.

## License
